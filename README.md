# WhyQA

This repository tackles the problem of WhyQA using the TellMeWhy dataset. You can find
TellMeWhy:

- GitHub: https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/tellmewhy
- JSON files: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eZfq0PuvQug7A25OnyRbfjf9eYuGW5s/view
- Hugging Face Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/StonyBrookNLP/tellmewhy

Either way, you want three files (based on the Google Drive link):
- `test_full.json`: test set (`test.json` on Hugging Face Datasets)
- `train.json`: train set
- `val.json`: validation set (`validation.json` on Hugging Face Datasets)
